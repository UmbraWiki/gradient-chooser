# gradient-chooser
A mini website to help choosing gradient for [UmbraWiki](https://umbrawiki.netsons.org/).

# how does it work?
The background is the same as UmbraWiki, so it is easy to see how a gradient would look like here. Put the hex for the colors, push the button and see the gradient with the two colors from left to right. The site check if you insert a correct hex, except on safari but don't worry because nothing strange happens if you do something wrong. It is also possible to copy the code that generate the gradient on UmbraWiki.
